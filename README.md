# OpenGLPlayGround

Working my way through the tutorials on 
https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-2-the-first-triangle/
until I can grease pencil some meshes.


## Commits correspond each tutorial + extra work I did for fun:
1. "Tutorial 1": Operating a window
2. "Tutorial 2": 2-D Triangle rendering
3. "Tutorial 3": Intrinsic/Extrinsic/Model Transforms
4. "Tutorial 4 + ..": Rendering a cube. Extra work: re-shading the same cube 2x with different Model transforms
4. "Moving Cube from -1 < x < 1 ": Moving a cube from the -1 x and +1 x positions, each frame
